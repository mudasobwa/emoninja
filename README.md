## Examples:

A thing of beauty is a 😹 for ever:  
Its lovliness increases; it will never  
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep  
A bower 🔕 for 🇻🇮, and a 🛏  
💯 of 🍮 dreams, and health, and 🔕 breathing.  
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing  
A flowery band to bind 🇻🇮 to the 🌐,  
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth  
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,  
Of all the unhealthy and 🅾'er-darkn'd ways  
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,  
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall  
From our 🌑 spirits. Such the 🌤, the 🌚,  
Trees 🗝 and young, sprouting a shady boon  
For simple 🐑; and such are daffodils  
With the 📗 🌎 they live in; and clear rills  
That for themselves a cooling covert make  
'Gainst the ☕ season; the mid-forest brake,  
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-🌹 blooms:  
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms  
We have imagined for the mighty dead;  
An endless ⛲ of immortal 🍾,  
Pouring unto 🇻🇮 from the heaven's brink.  

— A Thing Of Beauty (Endymion) - Poem by John Keats
