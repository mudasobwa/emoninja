ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

Lewis Carroll

CHAPTER I. 📩 the 🐇-🕳

Alice was beginning to get very 😩 of sitting by her sister on the
🏦, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
📗 her sister was reading, but it had 🙊 pictures or conversations in
it, 'and what is the 🇻🇮 of a 📗,' 💭 Alice 'without pictures or
conversations?'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
♨ day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
of making a daisy-⛓ would be worth the trouble of getting 🆙 and
⛏ the daisies, when suddenly a White 🐇 with pink 👀 ran
close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
VERY much out of the way to 🙉 the 🐇 say to itself, 'Oh dear!
Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she 💭 it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the 🐇 actually TOOK A ⌚
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
Alice started to her 🐾, for it 📸 across her mind that she had
never before seen a 🐇 with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a ⌚
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the 🏑
after it, and fortunately was just in time to 🙈 it pop 📩 a large
🐇-🕳 under the hedge.

In another moment 📩 went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the 🌏 she was to get out again.

The 🐇-🕳 went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly 📩, so suddenly that Alice had 🚯 a moment to think
about ⏹ herself before she found herself 🍂 📩 a very deep
well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went 📩 to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next. 🥇, she tried to look 📩 and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too 🌑 to 🙈 anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and 📗-shelves; here and there she saw 🗾 and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took 📩 a jar from 1️⃣ of the shelves as
she passed; it was 🏷 '🔶 MARMALADE', but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did 🚯 like to 💧 the jar for 😱
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into 1️⃣ of the cupboards as
she fell past it.

'Well!' 💭 Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling 📩 stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
🏡! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell 📴 the 🔝
of the 🏡!' (Which was very likely true.)

📩, 📩, 📩. Would the fall NEVER come to an 🔚! 'I wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the 🌐. Let me 🙈: that would be 🕓
thousand miles 📩, I think--' (for, you 🙈, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was 🚯 a VERY good opportunity for showing 📴 her knowledge, as there
was 🙊 1️⃣ to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
'--yes, that's about the ⏯ distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had 🙊 💡 what Latitude was, or
Longitude either, but 💭 they were nice grand words to say.)

🎁 she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall ⏯ THROUGH the
🌐! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that 🚶 with
their 🗣 downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad
there WAS 🙊 1️⃣ listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
⏯ word) '--but I shall have to 🙏 them what the Brow. of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this 🇳🇿 Zealand or 🇦🇺?' (and
she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're 🍂
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
ignorant little 👧 she'll think me for 🙏! 🙊, it'll never do to
🙏: perhaps I shall 🙈 it written 🆙 somewhere.'

📩, 📩, 📩. There was nothing else to do, so Alice 🔜 began
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-🌉, I should think!'
(Dinah was the 🐈.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of 🥛 at
🍵-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were 📩 here with me! There are 🙊
mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a 🦇, and that's very
like a 🐁, you know. But do 😽 eat 🏓, I wonder?' And here Alice
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, 'Do 😾 eat 🏏? Do 🐈 eat 🏓?' and sometimes, 'Do
🦇 eat 😹?' for, you 🙈, as she couldn't answer either ❓,
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
📴, and had just begun to dream that she was 🚶 ✌ in ✌ with
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
did you ever eat a 🦇?' when suddenly, thump! thump! 📩 she came upon
a heap of 🍢 and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was 🚯 a bit 🤕, and she jumped 🆙 on to her 🐾 in a moment:
she looked 🆙, but it was all 🌑 overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White 🐇 was still in sight, hurrying 📩 it.
There was 🚯 a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the 🎐, and
was just in time to 🙉 it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my 👂
and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the 🐇 was 🙊 longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, 🔅 hall, which was lit 🆙 by a row of 🛋 hanging
from the roof.

There were 🚪 all round the hall, but they were all 🔓; and when
Alice had been all the way 📩 1️⃣ side and 🆙 the other, trying every
🚪, she 🚶 sadly 📩 the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little 🔊-🍗 table, all made of solid
🍷; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden 🔑, and Alice's
🥇 💭 was that it might belong to 1️⃣ of the 🚪 of the hall;
but, alas! either the 🔑 were too large, or the 🔑 was too 🦐,
but at any rate it would 🚯 📬 any of them. However, on the 🥈
time round, she came upon a 🔅 curtain she had 🚯 noticed before, and
behind it was a little 🚪 about fifteen inches 🔊: she tried the
little golden 🔑 in the 🔒, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice 😅 the 🚪 and found that it led into a 🦐 passage, 🚯
much larger than a 🐀-🕳: she knelt 📩 and looked along the passage
into the loveliest 🏡 you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that 🌑 hall, and wander about among those 🛏 of 🌞 🌻 and
those 🆒 🖋, but she could 🚯 even get her 🗣 through the
doorway; 'and even if my 🗣 would go through,' 💭 poor Alice, 'it
would be of very little 🇺🇲 without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut 🆙 like a 🔭! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'
For, you 🙈, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible.

There seemed to be 🙊 🇻🇮 in waiting by the little 🚪, so she went
🔙 to the table, half hoping she might find another 🔑 on it, or at
any rate a 📗 of rules for shutting people 🆙 like telescopes: this
time she found a little 🍾 on it, ('which certainly was 🚯 here
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the 🍾 was a 🗞
🏷, with the words '🚱 ME' beautifully 👣 on it in large
🔡.

It was all very well to say '🚱 me,' but the 🦉 little Alice was
🚯 going to do THAT in a hurry. '🙊, I'll look 🥇,' she said, 'and
🙈 whether it's 🆙 "poison" or 🚯'; for she had read several nice
little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten 🆙 by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD 🚯 remember
the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a 🔽-♨
poker will burn you if you 👬 it too long; and that if you cut your
🤘 VERY deeply with a 🗡, it usually bleeds; and she had never
forgotten that, if you 🚱 much from a 🍾 ❕ 'poison,' it is
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this 🍾 was 🚯 ‼ 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
of 🍒-tart, 🍮, 🎍-🍏, roast 🦃, toffee, and ♨
buttered toast,) she very 🔜 finished it 📴.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting 🆙 like a
🔭.'

And so it was indeed: she was now only 🔟 inches 🔊, and her 😡
brightened 🆙 at the 💭 that she was now the ⏯ size for going
through the little 🚪 into that 💕 🏡. 🥇, however, she
waited for a few minutes to 🙈 if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might 🔚, you know,' said
Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a 🕯. I wonder
what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the 🔥 of a
🕯 is like after the 🕯 is blown out, for she could 🚯 remember
ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the 🏡 at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
🚪, she found she had forgotten the little golden 🔑, and when she
went 🔙 to the table for it, she found she could 🚯 possibly reach
it: she could 🙈 it quite plainly through the 🍷, and she tried her
best to climb 🆙 1️⃣ of the 🍗 of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had 😩 herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat 📩 and cried.

'Come, there's 🙊 🇺🇲 in 😢 like that!' said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave 📴 this minute!' She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring 😂 into
her 👀; and once she remembered trying to 🗳 her own 👂 for having
cheated herself in a 🎲 of croquet she was 🎴 against herself,
for this curious 🚸 was very fond of pretending to be 2️⃣ people.
'But it's 🙊 🇻🇮 now,' 💭 poor Alice, 'to pretend to be 2️⃣ people!
Why, there's hardly enough of me ◀ to make 1️⃣ respectable person!'

🔜 her 👁 fell on a little 🍷 🗳 that was lying under the table:
she 📬 it, and found in it a very 🦐 🍰, on which the words
'EAT ME' were beautifully 📑 in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the 🔑; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the 🚪; so either way I'll
get into the 🏡, and I don't 💅 which happens!'

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which
way?', 👬 her ✌ on the 🔝 of her 🗣 to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite 🙀 to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when 1️⃣ eats 🍰, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.

So she 📐 to work, and very 🔜 finished 📴 the 🍰.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

CHAPTER II. The Pool of 😹

'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much 🙀, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to 🗣 good English); 'now I'm
😃 out like the largest 🔭 that ever was! Good-bye, 🐾!'
(for when she looked 📩 at her 🐾, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far 📴). 'Oh, my poor little 🐾, I wonder
who will put on your 👢 and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far 📴 to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
kind to them,' 💭 Alice, 'or perhaps they 😤't 🚶 the way I want
to go! Let me 🙈: I'll give them a 🇳🇿 pair of 👢 every 🎄.'

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must
go by the carrier,' she 💭; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending
🎁 to 1️⃣'s own 🐾! And how odd the directions will look!

     ALICE'S ⏯ FOOT, ESQ.
       HEARTHRUG,
         NEAR THE FENDER,
           (WITH ALICE'S 🏩).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

Just then her 🗣 struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than 🕤 🐾 🔊, and she at once took 🆙 the little golden
🔑 and hurried 📴 to the 🏡 🚪.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying 📩 on 1️⃣ side, to
look through into the 🏡 with 1️⃣ 👁; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat 📩 and began to 😿 again.

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great 👧 like
you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on 😿 in this way! ⏹ this
moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
😿, until there was a large pool all round her, about 🕓 inches
deep and reaching half 📩 the hall.

After a time she 🇭🇲 a little pattering of 🐾 in the distance, and
she hastily dried her 👀 to 🙈 what was coming. It was the White
🐇 returning, splendidly 👗, with a pair of white kid 🥊 in
1️⃣ ✌ and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
Oh! 😤't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to 🙏 🆘 of any 1️⃣; so, when the 🐇
came near her, she began, in a 🔅, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'
The 🐇 started violently, 💧 the white kid 🥊 and the fan,
and skurried away into the 🌑 as hard as he could go.

Alice took 🆙 the fan and 🥊, and, as the hall was very ♨, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the 🌉? Let me think: was I the
same when I got 🆙 this 🌅? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different. But if I'm 🚯 the same, the next ❓ is, Who
in the 🌏 am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
🙈 if she could have been changed for any of them.

'I'm sure I'm 🚯 Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I 🇺🇲 to know. Let me
🙈: 🕓 times 🕠 is 🕧, and 🕓 times 6️⃣ is thirteen, and
🕓 times 7️⃣ is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
However, the ❌ Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
Rome--🙊, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for
Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she 🎌 her
🤞 on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to 🔁 it,
but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did 🚯 come the
same as they 🇻🇮 to do:--

     'How doth the little 🐊
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the 🚾 of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     'How cheerfully he seems to 😸,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little 🦈 in
      With gently 😙 jaws!'

'I'm sure those are 🚯 the ⏯ words,' said poor Alice, and her 👀
filled with 😂 again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little 🏡, and have next to
🙊 toys to ⏯ with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! 🙊, I've
made 🆙 my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay 📩 here! It'll be 🙊
🇺🇲 their putting their 🗣 📩 and saying "Come 🆙 again, dear!" I
shall only look 🆙 and say "Who am I then? Tell me that 🥇, and then,
if I like being that person, I'll come 🆙: if 🚯, I'll stay 📩 here
till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst
of 😢, 'I do wish they WOULD put their 🗣 📩! I am so VERY 😩
of being all alone here!'

As she said this she looked 📩 at her 👈, and was 🙀 to 🙈
that she had put on 1️⃣ of the 🐇's little white kid 🥊 while
she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she 💭. 'I must
be growing 🦐 again.' She got 🆙 and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
about 2️⃣ 🐾 🔊, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she 🔜 found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was 👫, and she ☔
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and
now for the 🏡!' and she ran with all 🚅 🔙 to the little 🚪:
but, alas! the little 🚪 was shut again, and the little golden 🔑 was
lying on the 🍷 table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'
💭 the poor 🚸, 'for I never was so 🦐 as this before, never!
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
she was 🆙 to her chin in salt 🤽. Her 🥇 💡 was that she
had somehow fallen into the ⛵, 'and in that case I can go 🔙 by
🚅,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of 🛀 machines in the
⛵, some children digging in the ⏳ with wooden ♠, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a 🚅 🚉.) However, she 🔜
made out that she was in the pool of 😿 which she had wept when she
was 🕤 🐾 🔊.

'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own 😂! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
However, everything is queer to-day.'

Just then she 🇭🇲 something splashing about in the pool a little way
📴, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at 🥇 she 💭
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how 🦐
she was now, and she 🔜 made out that it was only a 🐁 that had
slipped in like herself.

'Would it be of any 🇻🇮, now,' 💭 Alice, 'to 🗣 to this 🐁?
Everything is so out-of-the-way 📩 here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's 🙊 harm in trying.' So she
began: '🅾 🐁, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very 😩
of 👙 about here, 🅾 🐁!' (Alice 💭 this must be the ⏯
way of 🙊 to a 🐁: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother's 🔡 Grammar, 'A 🐁--of
a 🐁--to a 🐁--a 🐁--🅾 🐁!') The 🐁 looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to 😜 with 1️⃣ of its little 👀,
but it said nothing.

'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' 💭 Alice; 'I daresay it's
a 🇲🇫 🐁, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had 🙊 very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
was the 🥇 sentence in her 🇲🇫 lesson-📗. The 🐁 gave a
sudden leap out of the 🤽, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had 🤕
the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like 🐱.'

'🚯 like 😽!' cried the 🐁, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would
YOU like 😺 if you were me?'

'Well, perhaps 🚯,' said Alice in a soothing 🏽: 'don't be 💢
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our 🐈 Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to 😻 if you could only 🙈 her. She is such a dear 🔇
thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the 🔥, licking her 🐾 and
washing her 😡--and she is such a nice 🍦 thing to nurse--and she's
such a capital 1️⃣ for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
Alice again, for this time the 🐁 was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended. 'We 😤't talk about her any
more if you'd rather 🚯.'

'We indeed!' cried the 🐁, who was trembling 📩 to the 🔚 of his
tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our 👪 always HATED
🐱: nasty, 🔅, vulgar things! Don't let me 🙉 the Brow. again!'

'I 😤't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of 🐕?' The 🐁 did 🚯
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little 🐕 near
our 🏡 I should like to show you! A little 🌞-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
you throw them, and it'll sit 🆙 and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
you know, and he says it's so 🇺🇲, it's worth a hundred #️⃣! He
says it kills all the 🐀 and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
🏽, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the 🐁 was 🏊
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.

So she 🤙 softly after it, '🐁 dear! Do come 🔙 again, and we
😤't talk about 😻 or 🐶 either, if you don't like them!' When the
🐁 🇭🇲 this, it turned round and swam slowly 🔙 to her: its
😡 was quite pale (with passion, Alice 💭), and it said in a 🔅
trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate 🐱 and 🐶.'

It was 🔊 time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
🦉 and animals that had fallen into it: there were a 🦆 and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the 🏦--the
🕊 with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, ⛑, and uncomfortable.

The 🥇 ❓ of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
you, and must know better'; and this Alice would 🚯 allow without
knowing how 🗝 it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was 🙊 more to be said.

At last the 🐁, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
🤙 out, 'Sit 📩, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL 🔜 make you
dry enough!' They all sat 📩 at once, in a large 💍, with the 🐁
in the middle. Alice kept her 👀 anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad 🌨 if she did 🚯 get dry very 🔜.

'Ahem!' said the 🐁 with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was 🔜 submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--"'

'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.

'I beg your pardon!' said the 🐁, 😦, but very politely: 'Did
you 🗣?'

'🚯 I!' said the Lory hastily.

'I 💭 you did,' said the 🐁. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"'

'Found WHAT?' said the 🦆.

'Found IT,' the 🐁 replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
"it" means.'

'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the
🦆: 'it's generally a 🐸 or a worm. The ❓ is, what did the
archbishop find?'

The 🐁 did 🚯 notice this ❓, but hurriedly went on, '"--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
👑. William's conduct at 🥇 was moderate. But the insolence of his
Normans--" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning
to Alice as it spoke.

'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy 🏽: 'it doesn't seem to
dry me at all.'

'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, 💹 to its 🐾, 'I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--'

'🗣 English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And
the Eaglet bent 📩 its 🗣 to hide a 😆: some of the other 🦆
tittered audibly.

'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended 🏽, 'was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'

'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; 🚯 that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it 💭 that SOMEBODY ought to 🗣,
and 🙊 1️⃣ else seemed inclined to say anything.

'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.)

🥇 it ✅ out a race-course, in a sort of ⚪, ('the exact
shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was 🙊 '1️⃣, 2️⃣, 🔊, and
away,' but they began 💨 when they liked, and ◀ 📴 when they
liked, so that it was 🚯 easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been 💨 half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly 📲 out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
round it, panting, and 🙏, 'But who has 😤?'

This ❓ the Dodo could 🚯 answer without a great deal of 💭,
and it sat for a long time with 1️⃣ 🤘 pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually 🙈 Shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
'EVERYBODY has 😤, and all must have 🏆.'

'But who is to give the 🏆?' quite a chorus of voices 🙏.

'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, 👈 to Alice with 1️⃣ 🤘;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, 🤙 out in a confused
way, '🏆! 🏆!'

Alice had 🙊 💡 what to do, and in despair she put her ✌ in her
pocket, and pulled out a 🗳 of comfits, (luckily the salt 🤽 had
🚯 got into it), and 🖖 them round as 🏆. There was exactly 1️⃣
a-piece all round.

'But she must have a 🏆 herself, you know,' said the 🐁.

'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.

'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.

'✌ it over here,' said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
🎁 the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble'; and, when it had finished this short 🗨, they all cheered.

Alice 💭 the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did 🚯 dare to 🤣; and, as she could 🚯 think of anything
to say, she simply 🙏, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large 🦉 complained that they could 🚯 taste
theirs, and the 🦐 🔛 choked and had to be patted on the 🔙.
However, it was over at last, and they sat 📩 again in a 💍, and
begged the 🐁 to tell them something more.

'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why
it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

'Mine is a long and a 😿 tale!' said the 🐁, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking 📩 with wonder at
the 🐁's tail; 'but why do you 📲 it 😿?' And she kept on puzzling
about it while the 🐁 was 🙊, so that her 💡 of the tale was
something like this:--

         'Fury said to a
         🐁, That he
        met in the
       🏡,
     "Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         YOU.--Come,
           I'll take 🙊
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     🌅 I've
    nothing
    to do."
     Said the
      🐁 to the
       cur, "Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          🙊 jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath."
       "I'll be
        judge, I'll
         be jury,"
            Said
         cunning
          🗝 Fury:
          "I'll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           ⚱."'


'You are 🚯 attending!' said the 🐁 to Alice severely. 'What are you
thinking of?'

'I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: 'you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?'

'I had 🚯!' cried the 🐁, sharply and very angrily.

'A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself 🇻🇮, and looking
anxiously about her. 'Oh, do let me 🆘 to undo it!'

'I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the 🐁, getting 🆙 and 🚶
away. 'You insult me by talking such nonsense!'

'I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. 'But you're so easily offended,
you know!'

The 🐁 only growled in reply.

'Please come 🔙 and finish your story!' Alice 🤙 after it; and the
others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the 🐁 only shook
its 🗣 impatiently, and 🚶 a little quicker.

'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as 🔜 as it was quite
out of sight; and an 🗝 🦀 took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
YOUR temper!' '👬 your 👅, Ma!' said the 🌱 🦀, a little
snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'

'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
nobody in particular. 'She'd 🔜 fetch it 🔙!'

'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to 🙏 the ❓?' said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her 🐹:
'Dinah's our 🐈. And she's such a capital 1️⃣ for catching mice you
can't think! And oh, I wish you could 🙈 her after the 🦅! Why,
she'll eat a little 🐦 as 🔜 as look at it!'

This 🗨 caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
🐦 hurried 📴 at once: 1️⃣ 🗝 Magpie began wrapping itself 🆙 very
carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting 🏡; the 🌉-air
doesn't ♣ my throat!' and a Canary 🤙 out in a trembling voice to
its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's 🔊 time you were all in 🛏!'
On various pretexts they all moved 📴, and Alice was 🔜 ◀ alone.

'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy
🏽. 'Nobody seems to like her, 📩 here, and I'm sure she's the best
🐈 in the 🌏! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever 🙈 you
any more!' And here poor Alice began to 😿 again, for she felt very
lonely and 🔅-spirited. In a little while, however, she again 🇭🇲
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked 🆙
eagerly, half hoping that the 🐁 had changed his mind, and was coming
🔙 to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV. The 🐇 Sends in a Little 💶

It was the White 🐇, trotting slowly 🔙 again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she 🇭🇲
it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear 🐾! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where CAN I have 💧 them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid 🥊,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her 🏊 in
the pool, and the great hall, with the 🍷 table and the little 🚪,
had vanished completely.

Very 🔜 the 🐇 noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
🤙 out to her in an 💢 🏽, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
out here? Run 🏡 this moment, and fetch me a pair of 🥊 and a fan!
Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran 📴 at once
in the ↖ it 👈 to, without trying to explain the mistake it
had made.

'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
🙀 he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
his fan and 🥊--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
came upon a neat little 🏡, on the 🚪 of which was a 🌞 brass
🍽 with the Brow. 'W. 🐇' engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great 😱 lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the 🏡 before she had found the
fan and 🥊.

'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
a 🐇! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your 🚶!" "Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I've got to 🙈 that the 🐁 doesn't get out." Only I don't
think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah ⏹ in the 🏡 if it
began ordering people about like that!'

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and 2️⃣ or 🔊 pairs
of tiny white kid 🥊: she took 🆙 the fan and a pair of the 🥊,
and was just going to leave the room, when her 👁 fell upon a little
🍾 that stood near the looking-🍷. There was 🙊 🏷 this time
with the words '🚱 ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her 💋. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
to herself, 'whenever I eat or 🚱 anything; so I'll just 🙈 what
this 🍾 does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
I'm quite 😩 of being such a tiny little thing!'

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the 🍾, she found her 🗣 pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being 💔. She hastily put
📩 the 🍾, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't
grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the 🚪--I do wish I hadn't
drunk quite so much!'

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very 🔜 had to kneel 📩 on the 🤣: in another minute there
was 🚯 even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying 📩 with
1️⃣ elbow against the 🚪, and the other arm ➰ round her 🗣.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put 1️⃣ arm out
of the window, and 1️⃣ foot 🆙 the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I
can do 🙊 more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'

Luckily for Alice, the little magic 🍾 had now had its 🌝 effect,
and she grew 🙊 larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be 🙊 sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, 🙊 wonder she felt unhappy.

'It was much pleasanter at 🏡,' 💭 poor Alice, 'when 1️⃣ wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
🐰. I almost wish I hadn't gone 📩 that 🐇-🕳--and yet--and
yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
CAN have happened to me! When I 🇻🇮 to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of 1️⃣!
There ought to be a 📗 written about me, that there ought! And when I
grow 🆙, I'll ✍ 1️⃣--but I'm grown 🆙 now,' she added in a sorrowful
🏽; 'at least there's 🙊 room to grow 🆙 any more HERE.'

'But then,' 💭 Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am
now? That'll be a comfort, 1️⃣ way--never to be an 🗝 👩--but
then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'

'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and 🙊 room at all
for any lesson-📚!'

And so she went on, taking 🥇 1️⃣ side and then the other, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she 🇭🇲
a voice outside, and 🛑 to listen.

'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my 🥊 this moment!'
Then came a little pattering of 🐾 on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the 🐇 coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
🏡, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the 🐇, and had 🙊 reason to be afraid of it.

🎁 the 🐇 came 🆙 to the 🚪, and tried to 📬 it; but, as
the 🚪 😅 inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice 🇭🇲 it say to itself 'Then I'll
go round and get in at the window.'

'THAT you 😤't' 💭 Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she 🇭🇲 the 🐇 just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
✌, and made a snatch in the air. She did 🚯 get 👬 of anything,
but she 🇭🇲 a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of 💔 🍷,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
🥒-🖼, or something of the sort.

Next came an 💢 voice--the 🐇's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
then a voice she had never 🇭🇲 before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!'

'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the 🐇 angrily. 'Here! Come and
🆘 me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more 💔 🍷.)

'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'

'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')

'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw 1️⃣ that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!'

'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'

'Well, it's got 🙊 business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only 🙉 whispers
now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
✌ again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
2️⃣ little shrieks, and more sounds of 💔 🍷. 'What a number of
🥒-🖼 there must be!' 💭 Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'

She waited for some time without 🙉 anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little 🤸, and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but 1️⃣; 💶's got the other--💶!
fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em 🆙 at this corner--🙊, tie 'em
together 🥇--they don't reach half 🔊 enough yet--Oh! they'll
do well enough; don't be particular--Here, 💶! catch 👬 of this
rope--Will the roof 🐨?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
📩! 🗣 below!' (a 📢 crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was 💶, I
fancy--Who's to go 📩 the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
😤't, then!--💶's to go 📩--Here, 💶! the master says you're to
go 📩 the chimney!'

'Oh! So 💶's got to come 📩 the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon 💶! I wouldn't be in
💶's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I THINK I can 🛴 a little!'

She drew her foot as far 📩 the chimney as she could, and waited
till she 🇭🇲 a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself 'This is 💶,' she gave 1️⃣ sharp 🛴, and waited to
🙈 what would happen next.

The 🥇 thing she 🇭🇲 was a general chorus of 'There goes 💶!'
then the 🐇's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--'👬 🆙 his 🗣--Brandy
now--Don't choke him--How was it, 🗝 fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!'

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's 💶,' 💭
Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--🙊 more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
like a 🎃-in-the-🗳, and 🆙 I goes like a sky-🚀!'

'So you did, 🗝 fellow!' said the others.

'We must burn the 🏡 📩!' said the 🐇's voice; and Alice 🤙
out as 📢 as she could, 'If you do. I'll 📐 Dinah at you!'

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice 💭 to herself, 'I
wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof 📴.' After a minute or 2️⃣, they began moving about again, and
Alice 🇭🇲 the 🐇 say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'

'A barrowful of WHAT?' 💭 Alice; but she had 🚯 long to 🤷,
for the next moment a 🚿 of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them 🎯 her in the 😡. 'I'll put a ⏹ to this,'
she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better 🚯 do that again!'
which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little 🍥 as they lay on the 🤣, and a 🌞 💡 came into her
🗣. 'If I eat 1️⃣ of these 🍰,' she 💭, 'it's sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
make me smaller, I suppose.'

So she swallowed 1️⃣ of the 🍰, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As 🔜 as she was 🦐 enough to get through
the 🚪, she ran out of the 🏡, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and 🦆 waiting outside. The poor little 🦎, 💶, was
in the middle, being held 🆙 by 2️⃣ 🇵🇬-🐷, who were giving it
something out of a 🍾. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran 📴 as hard as she could, and 🔜 found herself
safe in a thick wood.

'The 🥇 thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered
about in the wood, 'is to grow to my ⏯ size again; and the 🥈
thing is to find my way into that 😍 🏡. I think that will be
the best plan.'

It sounded an excellent plan, 🙊 🤷, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had 🚯 the smallest 💡
how to 📐 about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the 🎄, a little sharp bark just over her 🗣 made her look 🆙 in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking 📩 at her with large round 👀, and
feebly stretching out 1️⃣ 🐾, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
said Alice, in a coaxing 🏽, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the 💭 that it might be
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her 🆙 in spite of
all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she ⛏ 🆙 a little bit of 🏒, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air 📴
all its 🐾 at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the 🏒,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the 🏒, and tumbled 🗣
over 👠 in its hurry to get 👬 of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a 🎲 of ⏯ with a 🛒-🐎, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its 🐾, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the 🏒, 💨 a very
little way ⏩ each time and a long way 🔙, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat 📩 a good way 📴, panting, with
its 👅 hanging out of its 👄, and its great 👀 half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
📐 📴 at once, and ran till she was quite 😩 and out of breath, and
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with 1️⃣ of the
leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
only been the ⏯ size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow 🆙 again! Let me 🙈--how IS it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or 🚱 something or other; but the great
❓ is, what?'

The great ❓ certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the 🥀 and the blades of grass, but she did 🚯 🙈 anything that
looked like the ⏯ thing to eat or 🚱 under the circumstances.
There was a large 🍄 growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and 🙈 what
was on the 🔝 of it.

She stretched herself 🆙 on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
🍄, and her 👀 immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the 🔝 with its arms folded, quietly 🚭 a long
hookah, and taking 🚯 the smallest notice of her or of anything else.




CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its 👄, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.

'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.

This was 🚯 an encouraging 😄 for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at 🎁--at least I know
who I WAS when I got 🆙 this 🌅, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.'

'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
yourself!'

'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm 🚯
myself, you 🙈.'

'I don't 🙈,' said the Caterpillar.

'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.'

'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a 🦋, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, 😤't you?'

'🚯 a bit,' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME.'

'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'

Which brought them 🔙 again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
short remarks, and she drew herself 🆙 and said, very gravely, 'I think,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, 🥇.'

'Why?' said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling ❓; and as Alice could 🚯 think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

'Come 🔙!' the Caterpillar 📲 after her. 'I've something important
to say!'

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came 🔙 again.

'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.

'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing 📩 her anger as well as she
could.

'🙊,' said the Caterpillar.

Alice 💭 she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth 🙉. For some
minutes it puffed away without 🗣, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its 👄 again, and said, 'So you think
you're changed, do you?'

'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
🇻🇮--and I don't keep the same size for 🔟 minutes together!'

'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY 🐝," but it all came
different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

'🔁, "YOU ARE 🗝, 👪 WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her ✊, and began:--

   'You are 🗝, 👪 William,' the 🌱 👨 said,
    'And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your 🗣--
    Do you think, at your age, it is ⏯?'

   'In my youth,' 👪 William replied to his son,
    'I 😱 it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.'

   'You are 🗝,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a 🔙-somersault in at the 🚪--
    Pray, what is the reason of that?'

   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey 🔑,
    'I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the 🇺🇲 of this ointment--1️⃣ shilling the 🗳--
    Allow me to sell you a 👨‍❤️‍👨?'

   'You are 🗝,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the 🍗 and the beak--
    Pray how did you manage to do it?'

   'In my youth,' said his 👪, 'I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.'

   'You are 🗝,' said the youth, '1️⃣ would hardly suppose
    That your 👁 was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the 🔚 of your 👃--
    What made you so awfully clever?'

   'I have answered 🔊 ⁉, and that is enough,'
    Said his 👪; 'don't give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be 📴, or I'll 🛴 you 📩 stairs!'


'That is 🚯 said ⏯,' said the Caterpillar.

'🚯 QUITE ⏯, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
have got altered.'

'It is wrong from beginning to 🔚,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the 🥇 to 🗣.

'What size do you want to be?' it 🙏.

'Oh, I'm 🚯 particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only 1️⃣
doesn't like changing so often, you know.'

'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.

'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
said Alice: '🔊 inches is such a wretched height to be.'

'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly 🔊 inches 🔊).

'But I'm 🚯 🇻🇮 to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous 🏽. And
she 💭 of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended!'

'You'll get 🇺🇲 to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its 👄 and began 🚭 again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to 🗣 again. In
a minute or 2️⃣ the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its 👄
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got 📩 📴 the
🍄, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
'1️⃣ side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.'

'1️⃣ side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' 💭 Alice to herself.

'Of the 🍄,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had 🙏 it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the 🍄 for a minute, trying
to make out which were the 2️⃣ sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult ❓. However, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke 📴 a bit
of the edge with each ✌.

'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the ⏯-✌ bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
🌬 underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was 🙊 time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
📐 to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to 📬 her
👄; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

'Come, my 🗣's 🆓 at last!' said Alice in a 🏽 of delight, which
changed into ⏰ in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could 🙈, when she looked 📩, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to 💹 like a stalk out of a
⛵ of 🍏 leaves that lay far below her.

'What CAN all that 🍏 stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor 🤘, how is it I can't 🙈 you?'
She was moving them about as she spoke, but 🙊 result seemed to follow,
except a little 🤝 among the distant 🍏 leaves.

As there seemed to be 🙊 chance of getting her 🙆 🆙 to her 🗣, she
tried to get her 🗣 📩 to them, and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any ↖, like a ⛎. She had
just succeeded in curving it 📩 into a graceful zigzag, and was going
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the 🎩
of the 🎄 under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
her draw 🔙 in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her 😡, and
was beating her violently with its wings.

'⛎!' 😱 the Pigeon.

'I'm 🚯 a ⛎!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'

'⛎, I say again!' 🔁 the Pigeon, but in a more subdued 🏽,
and added with a kind of 😭, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems
to ♣ them!'

'I haven't the least 💡 what you're talking about,' said Alice.

'I've tried the roots of 🌴, and I've tried 💷, and I've tried
hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those
⛎! There's 🙊 pleasing them!'

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she 💭 there was 🙊 🇺🇲 in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the 🥚,' said the Pigeon;
'but I must be on the look-out for 🐍 🌉 and day! Why, I
haven't had a 😜 of 😴 these 🔊 weeks!'

'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to
🙈 its meaning.

'And just as I'd taken the highest 🎋 in the wood,' continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I
should be 🆓 of them at last, they must needs come wriggling 📩 from
the sky! Ugh, ⛎!'

'But I'm 🚯 a ⛎, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'

'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can 🙈 you're trying to
invent something!'

'I--I'm a little 👧,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a 🏽 of the deepest
contempt. 'I've seen a good many little 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧 in my time, but never 1️⃣
with such a neck as that! 🙊, 🙊! You're a ⛎; and there's 🙊 🇻🇮
denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an
🥚!'

'I HAVE tasted 🥚, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
🚸; 'but little 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧 eat 🥚 quite as much as 🐍 do, you
know.'

'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
a kind of ⛎, that's all I can say.'

This was such a 🇳🇿 💡 to Alice, that she was quite 🔇 for a
minute or 2️⃣, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
looking for 🥚, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
whether you're a little 👧 or a ⛎?'

'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm 🚯 looking
for 🥚, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't
like them raw.'

'Well, be 📴, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky 🏽, as it settled
📩 again into its nest. Alice crouched 📩 among the 🌴 as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to ⏹ and untwist it. After a while she
remembered that she still held the pieces of 🍄 in her ✊, and
she 📐 to work very carefully, nibbling 🥇 at 1️⃣ and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself 📩 to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the ⏯ size, that it
felt quite strange at 🥇; but she got 🇺🇲 to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
to be, from 1️⃣ minute to another! However, I've got 🔙 to my ⏯
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful 🏡--how IS that
to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an 📬
place, with a little 🏡 in it about 🕓 🐾 🔊. 'Whoever lives
there,' 💭 Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the
righthand bit again, and did 🚯 venture to go near the 🏡 till she
had brought herself 📩 to 🕤 inches 🔊.




CHAPTER VI. 🐖 and 🌶

For a minute or 2️⃣ she stood looking at the 🏡, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came 💨 out of the
wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his 😡 only, she would have 🤙 him a
🐟)--and rapped loudly at the 🚪 with his knuckles. It was 👐
by another footman in livery, with a round 😡, and large 👀 like a
🐸; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that ➰ all
over their 🗣. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The 🐟-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great 📨,
nearly as large as himself, and this he ✊ over to the other,
saying, in a solemn 🏽, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the 👑
to ⏯ croquet.' The 🐸-Footman 🔁, in the same solemn 🏽,
only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the 👑. An
invitation for the Duchess to ⏯ croquet.'

Then they both 🏹 🔅, and their ➰ got entangled together.

Alice 🤣 so much at this, that she had to run 🔙 into the
wood for 😱 of their 🙉 her; and when she next peeped out the
🐟-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
🚪, staring stupidly 🆙 into the sky.

Alice went timidly 🆙 to the 🚪, and knocked.

'There's 🙊 sort of 🇺🇲 in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for
2️⃣ reasons. 🥇, because I'm on the same side of the 🚪 as you
are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, 🙊 1️⃣ could
possibly 🙉 you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a 📡 or kettle had been 💔 to pieces.

'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'

'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
without attending to her, 'if we had the 🚪 between us. For instance,
if you were 💠, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
He was looking 🆙 into the sky all the time he was 🗣, and this
Alice 💭 decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't 🆘 it,' she
said to herself; 'his 👀 are so VERY nearly at the 🔝 of his 🗣.
But at any rate he might answer ❓.--How am I to get in?' she
🔁, aloud.

'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'

At this moment the 🚪 of the 🏡 😆, and a large 🍽 came
skimming out, straight at the Footman's 🗣: it just grazed his 👃,
and broke to pieces against 1️⃣ of the 🌳 behind him.

'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same 🏽, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

'How am I to get in?' 🙏 Alice again, in a louder 🏽.

'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the 🥇
❓, you know.'

It was, 🙊 🤷: only Alice did 🚯 like to be told so. 'It's really
dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive 1️⃣ crazy!'

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for 🔁 his
remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and 📴, for
days and days.'

'But what am I to do?' said Alice.

'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.

'Oh, there's 🙊 🇻🇮 in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's
perfectly idiotic!' And she 👐 the 🚪 and went in.

The 🚪 led ⏯ into a large kitchen, which was 🌝 of smoke from
1️⃣ 🔚 to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a 🔊-🍗 stool in
the middle, nursing a 👶; the 🇨🇰 was leaning over the 🔥, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be 🌝 of soup.

'There's certainly too much 🌶 in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the 👶, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's ⏸. The only things in the kitchen
that did 🚯 sneeze, were the 🇨🇰, and a large 🐈 which was sitting on
the hearth and 😀 from 👂 to 👂.

'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
🚯 quite sure whether it was good manners for her to 🗣 🥇, 'why
your 🐈 😀 like that?'

'It's a Cheshire 🐈,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. 🐖!'

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the 👶,
and 🚯 to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

'I didn't know that Cheshire 😹 always 😸; in fact, I didn't know
that 😺 COULD 😸.'

'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'

'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'

Alice did 🚯 at all like the 🏽 of this remark, and 💭 it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on 1️⃣, the 🇨🇰 took the cauldron of soup 📴 the
🔥, and at once 📐 to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the 👶--the 🔥-irons came 🥇; then followed a
🚿 of saucepans, 🍽, and 📡. The Duchess took 🙊 notice of
them even when they 🎯 her; and the 👶 was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the 🌬 🤕 it or 🚯.

'Oh, 🙏 mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping 🆙 and 📩 in
an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS 👃'; as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it 📴.

'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, 'the 🌏 would go round a deal faster than it does.'

'Which would 🚯 be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing 📴 a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
what work it would make with the day and 🌉! You 🙈 the 🌐 takes
twenty-🕓 hours to turn round on its axis--'

'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop 📴 her 🗣!'

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the 🇨🇰, to 🙈 if she meant to take
the hint; but the 🇨🇰 was busily stirring the soup, and seemed 🚯 to
be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-🕓 hours, I THINK; or is
it 🕧? I--'

'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
And with that she began nursing her 🚸 again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent 🤝 at the 🔚 of
every line:

   '🗣 roughly to your little 👦,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
   He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.'

         CHORUS.

 (In which the 🇨🇰 and the 👶 joined):--

       'Wow! wow! wow!'

While the Duchess sang the 🥈 verse of the song, she kept tossing
the 👶 violently 🆙 and 📩, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly 🙉 the words:--

   'I 🗣 severely to my 👦,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The 🌶 when he pleases!'

         CHORUS.

       'Wow! wow! wow!'

'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the 👶 at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to ⏯
croquet with the 👑,' and she hurried out of the room. The 🇨🇰 threw
a frying-🥘 after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the 👶 with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little 👺, and held out its arms and 🍗 in all directions, 'just
like a 🌠-🐟,' 💭 Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
like a 🚂-🚒 when she caught it, and kept doubling itself 🆙 and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the 🥇 minute
or 2️⃣, it was as much as she could do to 👬 it.

As 🔜 as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it 🆙 into a sort of knot, and then keep tight 👬 of its ⏯
👂 and ◀ foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out into the 📬 air. 'IF I don't take this 🚸 away with me,'
💭 Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or 2️⃣: wouldn't it be
murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out 📢, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had ◀ 📴 sneezing by this time).
'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's 🚯 at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.'

The 👶 grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its 😡 to
🙈 what was the matter with it. There could be 🙊 🤷 that it had
a VERY turn-🆙 👃, much more like a snout than a real 👃; also its
👀 were getting extremely 🦐 for a 👶: altogether Alice did 🚯
like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only 😭,'
she 💭, and looked into its 👀 again, to 🙈 if there were any
😂.

🙊, there were 🙊 😿. 'If you're going to turn into a 🐖, my dear,'
said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!' The poor little thing 😭 again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
this 👺 when I get it 🏡?' when it grunted again, so violently,
that she looked 📩 into its 😡 in some ⏰. This time there could
be 🙊 mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a 🐖, and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

So she 📐 the little 👺 📩, and felt quite 😌 to 🙈
it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown 🆙,' she said
to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly 🚸: but it makes
rather a handsome 🐖, I think.' And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as 🐷, and was just saying
to herself, 'if 1️⃣ only knew the ⏯ way to change them--' when she
was a little startled by 🙈 the Cheshire 🐈 sitting on a bough of a
🎋 a few yards 📴.

The 🐈 only 😸 when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
💭: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did 🚯 at all know
whether it would like the Brow.: however, it only 😁 a little wider.
'Come, it's pleased so far,' 💭 Alice, and she went on. 'Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'

'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the 🐈.

'I don't much 💅 where--' said Alice.

'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the 🐈.

'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.

'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the 🐈, 'if you only 🚶 long
enough.'

Alice felt that this could 🚯 be denied, so she tried another ❓.
'What sort of people live about here?'

'In THAT ↖,' the 🐈 said, 🏴 its ⏯ 🐾 round, 'lives
a Hatter: and in THAT ↖,' 🏴 the other 🐾, 'lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they're both 😠.'

'But I don't want to go among 😠 people,' Alice remarked.

'Oh, you can't 🆘 that,' said the 🐈: 'we're all 😠 here. I'm 😠.
You're 😠.'

'How do you know I'm 😠?' said Alice.

'You must be,' said the 🐈, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'

Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
do you know that you're 😠?'

'To begin with,' said the 🐈, 'a 🐕's 🚯 😠. You grant that?'

'I suppose so,' said Alice.

'Well, then,' the 🐈 went on, 'you 🙈, a 🐕 growls when it's 💢,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
wag my tail when I'm 💢. Therefore I'm 😠.'

'I 📲 it purring, 🚯 growling,' said Alice.

'📲 it what you like,' said the 🐈. 'Do you ⏯ croquet with the
👑 to-day?'

'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited
yet.'

'You'll 🙈 me there,' said the 🐈, and vanished.

Alice was 🚯 much 🙀 at this, she was getting so 🇻🇮 to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

'By-the-bye, what became of the 👶?' said the 🐈. 'I'd nearly
forgotten to 🙏.'

'It turned into a 🐖,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come 🔙
in a natural way.

'I 💭 it would,' said the 🐈, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to 🙈 it again, but it did 🚯
appear, and after a minute or 2️⃣ she 🚶 on in the ↖ in
which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she
said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it 😤't be raving 😠--at least 🚯 so 😠 as
it was in March.' As she said this, she looked 🆙, and there was the 🐈
again, sitting on a branch of a 🎋.

'Did you say 🐖, or fig?' said the 🐈.

'I said 🐖,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make 1️⃣ quite giddy.'

'All ⏯,' said the 🐈; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the 🔚 of the tail, and 🔚 with the 😸, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

'Well! I've often seen a 🐈 without a 😸,' 💭 Alice; 'but a 😸
without a 🐈! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'

She had 🚯 gone much farther before she came in sight of the 🏡
of the March Hare: she 💭 it must be the ⏯ 🏡, because the
chimneys were shaped like 🌽 and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a 🏡, that she did 🚯 like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of 🍄, and 🙌 herself to
about 2️⃣ 🐾 🔊: even then she 🚶 🆙 towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving 😠 after all! I almost
wish I'd gone to 🙈 the Hatter instead!'




CHAPTER VII. A 😠 🍵-Party

There was a table 📐 out under a 🎋 in front of the 🏡, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having 🍵 at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, ⏩ asleep, and the other 2️⃣ were 🇺🇲 it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its 🗣. 'Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' 💭 Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
suppose it doesn't mind.'

The table was a large 1️⃣, but the 🔊 were all crowded together at
1️⃣ corner of it: '🙊 room! 🙊 room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
📩 in a large arm-💺 at 1️⃣ 🔚 of the table.

'Have some 🍷,' the March Hare said in an encouraging 🏽.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but 🍵.
'I don't 🙈 any 🍷,' she remarked.

'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.

'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.

'It wasn't very civil of you to sit 📩 without being invited,' said
the March Hare.

'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
many more than 🔊.'

'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his 🥇 🗨.

'You should learn 🚯 to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
severity; 'it's very rude.'

The Hatter 😃 his 👀 very wide on 🙉 this; but all he SAID
was, 'Why is a raven like a ✍-desk?'

'Come, we shall have some fun now!' 💭 Alice. 'I'm glad they've
begun 🙏 riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.

'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
March Hare.

'Exactly so,' said Alice.

'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.

'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know.'

'🚯 the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
that "I 🙈 what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I 🙈"!'

'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'

'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his 😴, 'that "I breathe when I 😴" is the same thing
as "I 😴 when I breathe"!'

'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
conversation 💧, and the party sat 🔇 for a minute, while Alice
💭 over all she could remember about ravens and ✍-desks,
which wasn't much.

The Hatter was the 🥇 to 💔 the silence. 'What day of the month
is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his ⌚ out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, 🤝 it every now and then,
and 👭 it to his 👂.

Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'

'2️⃣ days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't ♣
the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.

'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
'you shouldn't have put it in with the 🍞-🗡.'

The March Hare took the ⌚ and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his 🍶 of 🍵, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his 🥇 remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
you know.'

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
funny ⌚!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what 🅾'🕡 it is!'

'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR ⌚ tell you what
year it is?'

'Of course 🚯,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.'

'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have 🙊
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite
understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.

'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
♨ 🍵 upon its 👃.

The Dormouse shook its 🗣 impatiently, and said, without 😆 its
👀, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'

'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

'🙊, I give it 🆙,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'

'I haven't the slightest 💡,' said the Hatter.

'Nor I,' said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
time,' she said, 'than waste it in 🙏 riddles that have 🙊 answers.'

'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
about wasting IT. It's HIM.'

'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.

'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his 🗣 contemptuously.
'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'

'Perhaps 🚯,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time
when I learn 🎶.'

'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He 😤't stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
you liked with the 🕡. For instance, suppose it were 🕤 🅾'🕡 in
the 🌅, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the 🕡 in a twinkling! Half-past 1️⃣,
time for dinner!'

('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I
shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'

'🚯 at 🥇, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to
half-past 1️⃣ as long as you liked.'

'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice 🙏.

The Hatter shook his 🗣 mournfully. '🚯 I!' he replied. 'We
quarrelled last March--just before HE went 😠, you know--' (👉
with his 🍵 🥄 at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert
given by the 👑 of 💘, and I had to sing

     "Twinkle, twinkle, little 🦇!
     How I wonder what you're at!"

You know the song, perhaps?'

'I've 🇭🇲 something like it,' said Alice.

'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--

     "🆙 above the 🌏 you 💸,
     Like a 🍵-📥 in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle--"'

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its 😴 'Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it ⏹.

'Well, I'd hardly finished the 🥇 verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the
👑 jumped 🆙 and bawled out, "He's murdering the time! 📴 with his
🗣!"'

'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.

'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful 🏽, 'he 😤't
do a thing I 🙏! It's always 6️⃣ 🅾'🕡 now.'

A 🌞 💡 came into Alice's 🗣. 'Is that the reason so many
🍵-things are put out here?' she 🙏.

'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always 🍵-time,
and we've 🙊 time to wash the things between whiles.'

'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.

'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get 🇻🇮 🆙.'

'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured
to 🙏.

'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
'I'm getting 😩 of this. I vote the 🌱 lady tells us a story.'

'I'm afraid I don't know 1️⃣,' said Alice, rather ⏰ at the
proposal.

'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake 🆙, Dormouse!' And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly 😆 his 👀. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: 'I 🇭🇲 every word you fellows were saying.'

'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.

'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again
before it's done.'

'🔂 upon a time there were 🔊 little sisters,' the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; 'and their 📛 were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--'

'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in
❓ of eating and ☕.

'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
2️⃣.

'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd
have been 🤒.'

'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY 🤒.'

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

'Take some more 🍵,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended 🏽, 'so I can't
take more.'

'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take
MORE than nothing.'

'Nobody 🙏 YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter 🙏 triumphantly.

Alice did 🚯 quite know what to say to this: so she 🆘 herself
to some 🍵 and 🍞-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
🔁 her ❓. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

The Dormouse again took a minute or 2️⃣ to think about it, and then
said, 'It was a treacle-well.'

'There's 🙊 such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
yourself.'

'🙊, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I 😤't interrupt again. I
dare say there may be 1️⃣.'

'1️⃣, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. 'And so these 🔊 little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--'

'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

'I want a clean 🍶,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move 1️⃣ place
on.'

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only 1️⃣ who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse 📴 than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the 🥛-🏺 into his 🍽.

Alice did 🚯 wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?'

'You can draw 🤽 out of a 🤽-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'

'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, 🚯 choosing to
notice this last remark.

'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '--well in.'

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its 👀, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an M--'

'Why with an M?' said Alice.

'Why 🚯?' said the March Hare.

Alice was 🔇.

The Dormouse had 📕 its 👀 by this time, and was going 📴 into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke 🆙 again with
a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as
🐁-traps, and the 🎑, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever 🙈 such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?'

'Really, now you 🙏 me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't
think--'

'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could 🐨: she got 🆙 in
great disgust, and 🚶 📴; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked 🔙 once or twice, half hoping that they would 📲 after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she ⛏ her
way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest 🍵-party I ever was at in all
my life!'

Just as she said this, she noticed that 1️⃣ of the 🌳 had a 🚪
leading ⏯ into it. 'That's very curious!' she 💭. 'But
everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in
she went.

🔂 more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
🍷 table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden 🔑, and 🔓 the 🚪 that
led into the 🏡. Then she went to work nibbling at the 🍄 (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot 🔊:
then she 🚶 📩 the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
last in the beautiful 🏡, among the 🌞 🌻-🛏 and the 🆒
⛲.




CHAPTER VIII. The 👑's Croquet-Ground

A large 🌹-🎋 stood near the entrance of the 🏡: the 🌹
growing on it were white, but there were 🔊 🏡 at it, busily
🖌 them 🔽. Alice 💭 this a very curious thing, and she went
nearer to ⌚ them, and just as she came 🆙 to them she 🇭🇲 1️⃣ of
them say, 'Look out now, 🕠! Don't go splashing paint over me like
that!'

'I couldn't 🆘 it,' said 🕠, in a sulky 🏽; '7️⃣ jogged my
elbow.'

On which 7️⃣ looked 🆙 and said, 'That's ⏯, 🕠! Always lay the
blame on others!'

'YOU'D better 🚯 talk!' said 🕠. 'I 🇭🇲 the 👑 say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'

'What for?' said the 1️⃣ who had spoken 🥇.

'That's none of YOUR business, 2️⃣!' said 7️⃣.

'Yes, it IS his business!' said 🕠, 'and I'll tell him--it was for
bringing the 🇨🇰 🌷-roots instead of onions.'

7️⃣ flung 📩 his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust
things--' when his 👁 chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood ⌚
them, and he ☑ himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
all of them 🙏 🔅.

'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are 🖌
those 🌹?'

🕠 and 7️⃣ said nothing, but looked at 2️⃣. 2️⃣ began in a 🔅
voice, 'Why the fact is, you 🙈, Miss, this here ought to have been a
🔽 🌹-🎋, and we put a white 1️⃣ in by mistake; and if the 👑
was to find it out, we should all have our 🗣 cut 📴, you know.
So you 🙈, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this
moment 🕠, who had been anxiously looking across the 🏡, 📲
out 'The 👑! The 👑!' and the 🔊 🏡 instantly threw
themselves flat upon their 😫. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to 🙈 the 👑.

🥇 came 🔟 soldiers carrying ♣; these were all shaped like
the 🔊 🏡, oblong and flat, with their 💁 and 🐾 at the
corners: next the 🔟 courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
♦, and 🚶 2️⃣ and 2️⃣, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were 🔟 of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along ✌ in ✌, in couples: they were all ornamented
with ❣. Next came the guests, mostly 👑 and 👑, and among
them Alice recognised the White 🐇: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, 😻 at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of 💓, carrying the 👑's
👑 on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came THE 👑 AND 👑 OF ♥.

Alice was rather 🤷 whether she ought 🚯 to 🤥 📩 on her 😡
like the 🔊 🏡, but she could 🚯 remember ever having 🇭🇲
of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the 🇻🇮 of
a procession,' 💭 she, 'if people had all to 🤥 📩 upon their
😒, so that they couldn't 🙈 it?' So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all 🛑 and looked
at her, and the 👑 said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the
Knave of 💚, who only 🙏 and 😺 in reply.

'Idiot!' said the 👑, tossing her 🗣 impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, 'What's your Brow., 🚸?'

'My Brow. is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of 📇, after
all. I needn't be afraid of them!'

'And who are THESE?' said the 👑, ☝ to the 🔊 🏡 who
were lying round the rosetree; for, you 🙈, as they were lying on their
😆, and the pattern on their 🔙 was the same as the rest of the
pack, she could 🚯 tell whether they were 🏡, or soldiers, or
courtiers, or 🔊 of her own children.

'How should I know?' said Alice, 🙀 at her own courage. 'It's 🙊
business of MINE.'

The 👑 turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, 😱 '📴 with her 🗣! 📴--'

'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the 👑 was
🔇.

The 👑 laid his ✌ upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my
dear: she is only a 🚸!'

The 👑 turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them
over!'

The Knave did so, very carefully, with 1️⃣ foot.

'Get 🆙!' said the 👑, in a shrill, 📢 voice, and the 🔊
🏡 instantly jumped 🆙, and began 🙇 to the 👑, the 👑,
the royal children, and everybody else.

'Leave 📴 that!' 😱 the 👑. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
turning to the 🌹-🎋, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'

'May it please your Majesty,' said 2️⃣, in a very humble 🏽, going
📩 on 1️⃣ knee as he spoke, 'we were trying--'

'I 🙈!' said the 👑, who had meanwhile been examining the 🌹.
'📴 with their 🗣!' and the procession moved on, 🔊 of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate 🏡, who ran
to Alice for protection.

'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large
🌻-🍯 that stood near. The 🔊 soldiers wandered about for a
minute or 2️⃣, looking for them, and then quietly marched 📴 after the
others.

'Are their 🗣 📴?' shouted the 👑.

'Their 🗣 are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted
in reply.

'That's ⏯!' shouted the 👑. 'Can you ⏯ croquet?'

The soldiers were 🔇, and looked at Alice, as the ❓ was
evidently meant for her.

'Yes!' shouted Alice.

'Come on, then!' roared the 👑, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was
🚶 by the White 🐇, who was peeping anxiously into her 😡.

'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'

'Hush! Hush!' said the 🐇 in a 🔅, hurried 🏽. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then 🙌 himself upon
tiptoe, put his 👄 close to her 👂, and whispered 'She's under
sentence of execution.'

'What for?' said Alice.

'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the 🐇 🙏.

'🙊, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
"What for?"'

'She 📤 the 👑's 👯--' the 🐇 began. Alice gave a little
😱 of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the 🐇 whispered in a frightened
🏽. 'The 👑 will 🙉 you! You 🙈, she came rather late, and the
👑 said--'

'Get to your places!' shouted the 👑 in a voice of ⛈, and
people began 💨 about in all directions, tumbling 🆙 against each
other; however, they got settled 📩 in a minute or 2️⃣, and the 🎲
began. Alice 💭 she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the 🎱 were live hedgehogs,
the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to ⏪ themselves
🆙 and to stand on their 🖖 and 🐾, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at 🥇 was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its ☠ tucked away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its 🍗 hanging 📩, but generally, just as she had got
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
🌬 with its 🗣, it WOULD twist itself round and look 🆙 in her 😡,
with such a puzzled expression that she could 🚯 🆘 bursting out
😂: and when she had got its 🗣 📩, and was going to begin
again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-🆙 soldiers were always getting 🆙
and 🚶 📴 to other 〽 of the ground, Alice 🔜 came to the
conclusion that it was a very difficult 🎲 indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
time the 👑 was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting '📴 with his 🗣!' or '📴 with her 🗣!' about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had 🚯 as yet had any
dispute with the 👑, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
'and then,' 💭 she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any 1️⃣
◀ alive!'

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
in the air: it puzzled her very much at 🥇, but, after ⌚ it
a minute or 2️⃣, she made it out to be a 😸, and she said to herself
'It's the Cheshire 🐈: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'

'How are you getting on?' said the 🐈, as 🔜 as there was 👄
enough for it to 🗣 with.

Alice waited till the 👀 appeared, and then nodded. 'It's 🙊 🇺🇲
🙊 to it,' she 💭, 'till its 🌽 have come, or at least 1️⃣
of them.' In another minute the whole 🗣 appeared, and then Alice put
📩 her flamingo, and began an account of the 🎲, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The 🐈 seemed to think that there was
enough of it now in sight, and 🙊 more of it appeared.

'I don't think they ⏯ at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a
complaining 🏽, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully 1️⃣ can't 🙉
oneself 🗣--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've 🙊 💡 how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go through next 🚶 about at the other 🔚 of the
ground--and I should have croqueted the 👑's hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!'

'How do you like the 👑?' said the 🐈 in a 🔅 voice.

'🚯 at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed
that the 👑 was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the 🎲.'

The 👑 ☺ and passed on.

'Who ARE you talking to?' said the 👑, going 🆙 to Alice, and looking
at the 🐈's 🗣 with great curiosity.

'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire 🐈,' said Alice: 'allow me to
introduce it.'

'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the 👑: 'however, it may
💏 my ✌ if it likes.'

'I'd rather 🚯,' the 🐈 remarked.

'Don't be impertinent,' said the 👑, 'and don't look at me like that!'
He got behind Alice as he spoke.

'A 🐈 may look at a 👑,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some 📗,
but I don't remember where.'

'Well, it must be removed,' said the 👑 very decidedly, and he 🤙
the 👑, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
have this 🐈 removed!'

The 👑 had only 1️⃣ way of settling all difficulties, great or 🦐.
'📴 with his 🗣!' she said, without even looking round.

'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the 👑 eagerly, and he
hurried 📴.

Alice 💭 she might as well go 🔙, and 🙈 how the 🎲 was going
on, as she 🇭🇲 the 👑's voice in the distance, 😱 with
passion. She had already 🇭🇲 her sentence 🔊 of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did 🚯 like the look
of things at all, as the 🎲 was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or 🚯. So she went in 🔎 of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting 1️⃣ of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other side of the 🏡, where Alice could 🙈 it trying in a helpless
sort of way to 💸 🆙 into a 🎋.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it 🔙, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
matter much,' 💭 Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might 🚯
escape again, and went 🔙 for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got 🔙 to the Cheshire 🐈, she was 🙀 to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the 👑, and the 👑, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite 🔇, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all 🔊 to settle
the ❓, and they 🔁 their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut 📴 a 🗣 unless
there was a ☠ to cut it 📴 from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.

The 👑's argument was, that anything that had a 🗣 could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.

The 👑's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
than 🙊 time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:
you'd better 🙏 HER about it.'

'She's in prison,' the 👑 said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
And the executioner went 📴 like an 🔜.

 The 🐈's 🗣 began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come 🔙 with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the 👑 and the executioner ran wildly 🆙 and 📩
looking for it, while the rest of the party went 🔙 to the 🎲.




CHAPTER IX. The Mock 🐢's Story

'You can't think how glad I am to 🙈 you again, you dear 🗝 thing!'
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
they 🚶 📴 together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and 💭
to herself that perhaps it was only the 🌶 that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (🚯 in a very hopeful 🏽
though), 'I 😤't have any 🌶 in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
well without--Maybe it's always 🌶 that makes people ♨-tempered,'
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a 🇳🇿 kind of
rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
🎂-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so
stingy about it, you know--'

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she 🇭🇲 her voice close to her 👂. 'You're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.'

'Perhaps it hasn't 1️⃣,' Alice ventured to remark.

'Tut, tut, 🚸!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
you can find it.' And she squeezed herself 🆙 closer to Alice's side as
she spoke.

Alice did 🚯 much like keeping so close to her: 🥇, because the
Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
⏯ height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did 🚯 like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

'The 🎲's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping 🆙
the conversation a little.

''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis 🏩,
'tis 🏩, that makes the 🌏 go round!"'

'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding
their own business!'

'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral
of THAT is--"Take 💅 of the sense, and the sounds will take 💅 of
themselves."'

'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice 💭 to herself.

'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
the Duchess said after a ⏸: 'the reason is, that I'm 🤷 about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'

'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, 🚯 feeling at all anxious to
have the experiment tried.

'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is--"🦆 of a feather flock together."'

'Only mustard isn't a 🐦,' Alice remarked.

'⏯, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of
putting things!'

'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.

'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And
the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours."'

'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had 🚯 attended to this last remark,
'it's a 🥒. It doesn't look like 1️⃣, but it is.'

'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that
is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put more
simply--"Never imagine yourself 🚯 to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was 🚯 otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'

'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if
I had it written 📩: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'

'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in
a pleased 🏽.

'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said
Alice.

'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a 🎁
of everything I've said as yet.'

'A cheap sort of 🎁!' 💭 Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give
birthday 🎁 like that!' But she did 🚯 venture to say it out
📢.

'Thinking again?' the Duchess 🙏, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

'I've a ⏯ to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

'Just about as much ⏯,' said the Duchess, 'as 🐗 have to 💸; and
the m--'

But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even
in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was 🖇
into hers began to tremble. Alice looked 🆙, and there stood the 👑
in front of them, with her arms folded, 🙍 like a thunderstorm.

'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a 🔅, weak voice.

'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the 👑, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; 'either you or your 🗣 must be 📴, and that in
about half 🙊 time! Take your choice!'

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

'Let's go on with the 🎲,' the 👑 said to Alice; and Alice was
too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her 🔙 to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the 👑's absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
🔙 to the 🎲, the 👑 merely remarking that a moment's delay would
cost them their lives.

All the time they were 🎴 the 👑 never ◀ 📴 quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting '📴 with his 🗣!' or '📴 with her
🗣!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave 📴 being arches to do this, so that by
the 🔚 of half an hour or so there were 🙊 arches ◀, and all the
players, except the 👑, the 👑, and Alice, were in custody and
under sentence of execution.

Then the 👑 ◀ 📴, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have
you seen the Mock 🐢 yet?'

'🙊,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock 🐢 is.'

'It's the thing Mock 🐢 Soup is made from,' said the 👑.

'I never saw 1️⃣, or 🇭🇲 of 1️⃣,' said Alice.

'Come on, then,' said the 👑, 'and he shall tell you his history,'

As they 🚶 📴 together, Alice 🇭🇲 the 👑 say in a 🔅 voice,
to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good
thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the 👑 had ordered.

They very 🔜 came upon a Gryphon, lying ⏩ asleep in the 🌇.
(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) '🆙, lazy
thing!' said the 👑, 'and take this 🌱 lady to 🙈 the Mock
🐢, and to 🙉 his history. I must go 🔙 and 🙈 after some
executions I have ordered'; and she 🚶 📴, leaving Alice alone with
the Gryphon. Alice did 🚯 quite like the look of the 👺, but on
the whole she 💭 it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage 👑: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat 🆙 and rubbed its 👀: then it ⌚ the 👑 till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

'What IS the fun?' said Alice.

'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!'

'Everybody says "come on!" here,' 💭 Alice, as she went slowly
after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'

They had 🚯 gone far before they saw the Mock 🐢 in the distance,
sitting 😿 and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could 🙉 him sighing as if his 💔 would 💔. She
pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she 🙏 the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
fancy, that: he hasn't got 🙊 sorrow, you know. Come on!'

So they went 🆙 to the Mock 🐢, who looked at them with large 👀
🌝 of 😹, but said nothing.

'This here 🌱 lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your
history, she do.'

'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock 🐢 in a deep, hollow 🏽: 'sit
📩, both of you, and don't 🗣 a word till I've finished.'

So they sat 📩, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice 💭 to
herself, 'I don't 🙈 how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But
she waited patiently.

'🔂,' said the Mock 🐢 at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real
🐢.'

These words were followed by a very long silence, 💔 only by an
occasional ❕ of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy 😭 of the Mock 🐢. Alice was very nearly getting 🆙 and
saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could
🚯 🆘 thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

'When we were little,' the Mock 🐢 went on at last, more calmly,
though still 😭 a little now and then, 'we went to 🏫 in the
⛵. The master was an 🗝 🐢--we 🇺🇲 to 📲 him Tortoise--'

'Why did you 📲 him Tortoise, if he wasn't 1️⃣?' Alice 🙏.

'We 📲 him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock 🐢
angrily: 'really you are very dull!'

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for 🙏 such a simple ❓,'
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat 🔇 and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the 🌐. At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock 🐢, 'Drive on, 🗝 fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
and he went on in these words:

'Yes, we went to 🏫 in the ⛵, though you mayn't believe it--'

'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.

'You did,' said the Mock 🐢.

'👬 your 👅!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could 🗣 again.
The Mock 🐢 went on.

'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to 🏫 every day--'

'I'VE been to a day-🏫, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
as all that.'

'With extras?' 🙏 the Mock 🐢 a little anxiously.

'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned 🇲🇫 and 🎶.'

'And washing?' said the Mock 🐢.

'Certainly 🚯!' said Alice indignantly.

'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good 🏫,' said the Mock 🐢 in
a 🏽 of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the 🔚 of the 💶,
"🇲🇫, 🎶, AND WASHING--extra."'

'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of
the ⛵.'

'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock 🐢 with a sigh. 'I
only took the regular course.'

'What was that?' inquired Alice.

'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock 🐢
replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'

'I never 🇭🇲 of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'

The Gryphon lifted 🆙 both its 🐾 in surprise. 'What! Never 🇭🇲 of
uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'

'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'

'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton.'

Alice did 🚯 feel encouraged to 🙏 any more ⁉ about it, so she
turned to the Mock 🐢, and said 'What else had you to learn?'

'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock 🐢 replied, counting 📴
the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an 🗝 conger-eel,
that 🇻🇮 to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.'

'What was THAT like?' said Alice.

'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock 🐢 said: 'I'm too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'

'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.
He was an 🗝 🦀, HE was.'

'I never went to him,' the Mock 🐢 said with a sigh: 'he taught
🤣 and Grief, they 🇺🇲 to say.'

'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their 😅 in their 🐾.

'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.

'🔟 hours the 🥇 day,' said the Mock 🐢: '🕤 the next, and so
on.'

'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.

'That's the reason they're 🤙 lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
'because they lessen from day to day.'

This was quite a 🇳🇿 💡 to Alice, and she 💭 it over a little
before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?'

'Of course it was,' said the Mock 🐢.

'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.

'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided
🏽: 'tell her something about the 🀄 now.'




CHAPTER ❌. The Lobster Quadrille

The Mock 🐢 sighed deeply, and drew the 🔙 of 1️⃣ flapper across
his 👀. He looked at Alice, and tried to 🗣, but for a minute or
2️⃣ 😭 choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a 🍗 in his throat,'
said the Gryphon: and it 📐 to work 🤝 him and 👊 him in
the 🔙. At last the Mock 🐢 recovered his voice, and, with 😹
💨 📩 his cheeks, he went on again:--

'You may 🚯 have lived much under the ⛵--' ('I haven't,' said
Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but ✔ herself hastily, and
said '🙊, never') '--so you can have 🙊 💡 what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!'

'🙊, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'

'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you 🥇 form into a line along the
⛵-shore--'

'2️⃣ lines!' cried the Mock 🐢. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-🐟 out of the way--'

'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.

'--you advance twice--'

'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.

'Of course,' the Mock 🐢 said: 'advance twice, 📐 to partners--'

'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.

'Then, you know,' the Mock 🐢 went on, 'you throw the--'

'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

'--as far out to ⛵ as you can--'

'🏊 after them!' 😱 the Gryphon.

'Turn a somersault in the ⛵!' cried the Mock 🐢, capering wildly
about.

'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the 🔝 of its voice.

'🔙 to land again, and that's all the 🥇 figure,' said the Mock
🐢, suddenly 💧 his voice; and the 2️⃣ creatures, who had been
jumping about like 😠 things all this time, sat 📩 again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice.

'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.

'Would you like to 🙈 a little of it?' said the Mock 🐢.

'Very much indeed,' said Alice.

'Come, let's try the 🥇 figure!' said the Mock 🐢 to the Gryphon.
'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'

'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and 🏴 their
forepaws to ❗ the time, while the Mock 🐢 sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 '"Will you 🚶 a little faster?" said a whiting to a 🐌.
 "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.

 🙈 how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, 😤't you, will you, 😤't you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, 😤't you, will you, 😤't you, 😤't you join the dance?

 "You can really have 🙊 notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us 🆙 and throw us, with the lobsters, out to ⛵!"
 But the 🐌 replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--
 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would 🚯 join the dance.

 Would 🚯, could 🚯, would 🚯, could 🚯, would 🚯 join the dance.
 Would 🚯, could 🚯, would 🚯, could 🚯, could 🚯 join the dance.

 '"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
 "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further 📴 from 🇬🇧 the nearer is to France--
 Then turn 🚯 pale, beloved 🐌, but come and join the dance.

 Will you, 😤't you, will you, 😤't you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, 😤't you, will you, 😤't you, 😤't you join the dance?"'

'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to ⌚,' said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: 'and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting!'

'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock 🐢, 'they--you've seen them,
of course?'

'Yes,' said Alice, 'I've often seen them at dinn--' she ☑ herself
hastily.

'I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock 🐢, 'but if you've
seen them so often, of course you know what they're like.'

'I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They have their tails in
their 😺--and they're all over crumbs.'

'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock 🐢: 'crumbs would all
wash 📴 in the ⛵. But they HAVE their tails in their 😶; and the
reason is--' here the Mock 🐢 yawned and shut his 👀.--'Tell her
about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.

'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to ⛵. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got their tails ⏩ in their 😰. So they couldn't get
them out again. That's all.'

'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.'

'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you
know why it's 🤙 a whiting?'

'I never 💭 about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'

'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the 👢 and 👞!' she 🔁
in a wondering 🏽.

'Why, what are YOUR 👡 done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what
makes them so shiny?'

Alice looked 📩 at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. 'They're done with 🖤, I believe.'

'👢 and 👢 under the ⛵,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'

'And what are they made of?' Alice 🙏 in a 🏽 of great curiosity.

'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
'any 🦐 could have told you that.'

'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose 💭 were still 💨
on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep 🔙, please: we
don't want YOU with us!"'

'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock 🐢 said: '🙊
🦉 🐟 would go anywhere without a porpoise.'

'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a 🏽 of great surprise.

'Of course 🚯,' said the Mock 🐢: 'why, if a 🐟 came to ME, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say "With what porpoise?"'

'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.

'I mean what I say,' the Mock 🐢 replied in an offended 🏽. And
the Gryphon added 'Come, let's 🙉 some of YOUR adventures.'

'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this 🌅,' said
Alice a little timidly: 'but it's 🙊 🇻🇮 going 🔙 to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.'

'Explain all that,' said the Mock 🐢.

'🙊, 🙊! The adventures 🥇,' said the Gryphon in an impatient 🏽:
'explanations take such a dreadful time.'

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she 🥇
saw the White 🐇. She was a little nervous about it just at 🥇,
the 2️⃣ creatures got so close to her, 1️⃣ on each side, and 📖
their 👀 and 😦 so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. Her listeners were perfectly 🔇 till she got to the 〽 about
her 🔁 'YOU ARE 🗝, 👪 WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock 🐢 drew a long breath,
and said 'That's very curious.'

'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.

'It all came different!' the Mock 🐢 🔁 thoughtfully. 'I
should like to 🙉 her try and 🔁 something now. Tell her to
begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he 💭 it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

'Stand 🆙 and 🔁 "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said the
Gryphon.

'How the creatures order 1️⃣ about, and make 1️⃣ 🔁 lessons!'
💭 Alice; 'I might as well be at 🏫 at once.' However, she
got 🆙, and began to 🔁 it, but her 🗣 was so 🌝 of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

  ''Tis the voice of the Lobster; I 🇭🇲 him declare,
  "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
  As a 🦆 with its eyelids, so he with his 👃
  Trims his belt and his 🔽, and turns out his toes.'

       [later editions continued as follows
  When the ⌛ are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous 🏿 of the 🦈,
  But, when the tide 💹 and 🦈 are around,
  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]

'That's different from what I 🇻🇮 to say when I was a 🚸,' said the
Gryphon.

'Well, I never 🇭🇲 it before,' said the Mock 🐢; 'but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.'

Alice said nothing; she had sat 📩 with her 😡 in her 👬,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.

'I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock 🐢.

'She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. 'Go on with the next
verse.'

'But about his toes?' the Mock 🐢 persisted. 'How COULD he turn them
out with his 👃, you know?'

'It's the 🥇 position in dancing.' Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon 🔁 impatiently: 'it
begins "I passed by his 🏡."'

Alice did 🚯 dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  'I passed by his 🏡, and 💋, with 1️⃣ 👁,
  How the 🦉 and the Panther were sharing a pie--'

    [later editions continued as follows
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and 🥓,
  While the 🦉 had the 📡 as its share of the treat.
  When the pie was all finished, the 🦉, as a boon,
  Was kindly permitted to pocket the 🥄:
  While the Panther received 🗡 and 🍴 with a growl,
  And concluded the banquet--]

'What IS the 🇻🇮 of 🔁 all that stuff,' the Mock 🐢
interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most
confusing thing I ever 🇭🇲!'

'Yes, I think you'd better leave 📴,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went
on. 'Or would you like the Mock 🐢 to sing you a song?'

'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock 🐢 would be so kind,' Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended 🏽,
'Hm! 🙊 accounting for tastes! Sing her "🐢 Soup," will you, 🗝
fellow?'

The Mock 🐢 sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with 😭, to sing this:--

   'Beautiful Soup, so rich and 🍏,
   Waiting in a ♨ tureen!
   Who for such dainties would 🚯 stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   'Beautiful Soup! Who 💅 for 🐟,
   🎲, or any other 📡?
   Who would 🚯 give all else for 2️⃣
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'

'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock 🐢 had just begun
to 🔁 it, when a 😿 of 'The trial's beginning!' was 🇭🇲 in the
distance.

'Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the ✌, it hurried
📴, without waiting for the 🔚 of the song.

'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   'Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'




CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?

The 👑 and 👑 of 💌 were 💺 on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
🐦 and beasts, as well as the whole pack of ♣: the Knave was
standing before them, in ⛓, with a soldier on each side to 💂
him; and near the 👑 was the White 🐇, with a 🎺 in 1️⃣ ✌,
and a 📜 of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large 📡 of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the
trial done,' she 💭, 'and ✌ round the refreshments!' But there
seemed to be 🙊 chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of ♎ before, but she had read
about them in 📚, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the Brow. of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to
herself, 'because of his great wig.'

The judge, by the way, was the 👑; and as he wore his 👑 over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to 🙈 how he did it,) he did
🚯 look at all comfortable, and it was certainly 🚯 becoming.

'And that's the jury-🗳,' 💭 Alice, 'and those 🕧 creatures,'
(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you 🙈, because some of them were
animals, and some were 🐦,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said
this last word 2️⃣ or 🔊 times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she 💭, and rightly too, that very few little 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 of her
age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done
just as well.

The 🕧 jurors were all ✍ very busily on slates. 'What are they
doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put
📩 yet, before the trial's begun.'

'They're putting 📩 their 📛,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for
😱 they should forget them before the 🔚 of the trial.'

'Stupid things!' Alice began in a 📢, indignant voice, but she ⏹
hastily, for the White 🐇 cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the
👑 put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
was talking.

Alice could 🙈, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were ✍ 📩 'stupid things!' on their slates,
and she could even make out that 1️⃣ of them didn't know how to spell
'stupid,' and that he had to 🙏 his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice
muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' 💭 Alice.

1️⃣ of the jurors had a ✏ that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could 🚯 stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very 🔜 found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was 💶, the 🦎) could 🚯 make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to ✍ with 1️⃣ 🤘 for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little 🇺🇲, as it ◀ 🙊 ❗ on the slate.

'Herald, read the accusation!' said the 👑.

On this the White 🐇 blew 🔊 blasts on the 🎺, and then
unrolled the parchment 📜, and read as follows:--

   'The 👑 of 💗, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of ♥, he stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away!'

'Consider your verdict,' the 👑 said to the jury.

'🚯 yet, 🚯 yet!' the 🐇 hastily interrupted. 'There's a great
deal to come before that!'

'📲 the 🥇 witness,' said the 👑; and the White 🐇 blew 🔊
blasts on the 🎺, and 📲 out, '🥇 witness!'

The 🥇 witness was the Hatter. He came in with a 🍵 in 1️⃣
✌ and a piece of 🍞-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your
Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
my 🍵 when I was 📤 for.'

'You ought to have finished,' said the 👑. 'When did you begin?'

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
was,' he said.

'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.

'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.

'✍ that 📩,' the 👑 said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote 📩 all 🔊 📅 on their slates, and then added them 🆙, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

'Take 📴 your 👷,' the 👑 said to the Hatter.

'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.

'Stolen!' the 👑 exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
memorandum of the fact.

'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
my own. I'm a hatter.'

Here the 👑 put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

'Give your evidence,' said the 👑; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot.'

This did 🚯 seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from 1️⃣ foot to the other, looking uneasily at the 👑, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his 🍵 instead of the
🍞-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she 💭 at 🥇 she would get 🆙 and leave
the court; but on 🥈 💭 she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.

'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'

'I can't 🆘 it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'

'You've 🙊 ⏯ to grow here,' said the Dormouse.

'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
too.'

'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: '🚯 in that
ridiculous fashion.' And he got 🆙 very sulkily and 🎌 over to the
other side of the court.

All this time the 👑 had never ◀ 📴 staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse 🎌 the court, she said to 1️⃣ of the officers
of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his 👡 📴.

'Give your evidence,' the 👑 🔁 angrily, 'or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or 🚯.'

'I'm a poor 👨, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
'--and I hadn't begun my 🍵--🚯 above a week or so--and what with the
🍞-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the 🍵--'

'The twinkling of the what?' said the 👑.

'It began with the 🍵,' the Hatter replied.

'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the 👑 sharply. 'Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!'

'I'm a poor 👨,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said--'

'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

'You did!' said the Hatter.

'I deny it!' said the March Hare.

'He denies it,' said the 👑: 'leave out that 〽.'

'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to 🙈 if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being ⏩ asleep.

'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more 🍞-and-butter--'

'But what did the Dormouse say?' 1️⃣ of the jury 🙏.

'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.

'You MUST remember,' remarked the 👑, 'or I'll have you executed.'

The miserable Hatter 💧 his 🍵 and 🍞-and-butter, and went
📩 on 1️⃣ knee. 'I'm a poor 👨, your Majesty,' he began.

'You're a very poor 🔈,' said the 👑.

Here 1️⃣ of the 🇵🇬-🐷 cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas 🛍, which tied
🆙 at the 👄 with strings: into this they slipped the 🇵🇬-🐖,
🗣 🥇, and then sat upon it.)

'I'm glad I've seen that done,' 💭 Alice. 'I've so often read
in the newspapers, at the 🔚 of trials, "There was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'

'If that's all you know about it, you may stand 📩,' continued the
👑.

'I can't go 🙊 lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the 🤣, as it is.'

'Then you may SIT 📩,' the 👑 replied.

Here the other 🇵🇬-🐖 cheered, and was suppressed.

'Come, that finished the 🇵🇬-🐖!' 💭 Alice. 'Now we shall get
on better.'

'I'd rather finish my 🍵,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
👑, who was reading the list of singers.

'You may go,' said the 👑, and the Hatter hurriedly ◀ the court,
without even waiting to put his 👟 on.

'--and just take his 🗣 📴 outside,' the 👑 added to 1️⃣ of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the 🚪.

'📲 the next witness!' said the 👑.

The next witness was the Duchess's 🇨🇰. She carried the 🌶-🗳 in
her ✌, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the 🚪 began sneezing all at once.

'Give your evidence,' said the 👑.

'Shan't,' said the 🇨🇰.

The 👑 looked anxiously at the White 🐇, who said in a 🔅 voice,
'Your Majesty must ⛑-examine THIS witness.'

'Well, if I must, I must,' the 👑 said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and 😦 at the 🇨🇰 till his 👀 were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'

'🌶, mostly,' said the 🇨🇰.

'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.

'Collar that Dormouse,' the 👑 shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! 📴 with his
whiskers!'

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled 📩 again, the 🇨🇰 had
disappeared.

'Never mind!' said the 👑, with an air of great relief. '📲 the next
witness.' And he added in an undertone to the 👑, 'Really, my dear,
YOU must ⛑-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache!'

Alice ⌚ the White 🐇 as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to 🙈 what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
the White 🐇 read out, at the 🔝 of his shrill little voice, the
Brow. 'Alice!'




CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence


'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped 🆙 in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-🗳 with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the 🗣 of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a 🌐 of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before.

'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a 🏽 of great dismay, and
began ⛏ them 🆙 again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept 💨 in her 🗣, and she had a vague sort of 💡
that they must be collected at once and put 🔙 into the jury-🗳, or
they would 🎲.

'The trial cannot proceed,' said the 👑 in a very grave voice, 'until
all the jurymen are 🔙 in their proper places--ALL,' he 🔁 with
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.

Alice looked at the jury-🗳, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the 🦎 in 🗣 downwards, and the poor little thing was 🏴 its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She 🔜 got
it out again, and put it ⏯; '🚯 that it signifies much,' she said
to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much 🇻🇮 in the trial
1️⃣ way 🆙 as the other.'

As 🔜 as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and 📝 had been found and 👉 🔙 to
them, they 📐 to work very diligently to ✍ out a history of the
accident, all except the 🦎, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its 👄 📬, gazing 🆙 into the roof of the
court.

'What do you know about this business?' the 👑 said to Alice.

'Nothing,' said Alice.

'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the 👑.

'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.

'That's very important,' the 👑 said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to ✍ this 📩 on their slates, when the White 🐇
interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a
very respectful 🏽, but ☹ and making 🐻 at him as he spoke.

'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the 👑 hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it 📩 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
Alice could 🙈 this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she 💭 to herself.

At this moment the 👑, who had been for some time busily ✍ in
his 💴-📗, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his 📗, 'Rule
Forty-2️⃣. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE 🔊 TO LEAVE THE COURT.'

Everybody looked at Alice.

'I'M 🚯 a mile 🔊,' said Alice.

'You are,' said the 👑.

'Nearly 2️⃣ miles 🔊,' added the 👑.

'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's 🚯 a
regular rule: you invented it just now.'

'It's the oldest rule in the 📗,' said the 👑.

'Then it ought to be Number 1️⃣,' said Alice.

The 👑 turned pale, and shut his 💴-📗 hastily. 'Consider your
verdict,' he said to the jury, in a 🔅, trembling voice.

'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White
🐇, jumping 🆙 in a great hurry; 'this 🗞 has just been ⛏
🆙.'

'What's in it?' said the 👑.

'I haven't 😄 it yet,' said the White 🐇, 'but it seems to be a
📨, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'

'It must have been that,' said the 👑, 'unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'

'Who is it directed to?' said 1️⃣ of the jurymen.

'It isn't directed at all,' said the White 🐇; 'in fact, there's
nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the 🗞 as he spoke, and
added 'It isn't a 📨, after all: it's a 📐 of verses.'

'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' 🙏 another of the jurymen.

'🙊, they're 🚯,' said the White 🐇, 'and that's the queerest thing
about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)

'He must have imitated somebody else's ✌,' said the 👑. (The jury
all brightened 🆙 again.)

'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't ✍ it, and they
can't prove I did: there's 🙊 Brow. signed at the 🔚.'

'If you didn't sign it,' said the 👑, 'that only makes the matter
worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
Brow. like an honest 👨.'

There was a general 👏 of 🤙 at this: it was the 🥇 really
clever thing the 👑 had said that day.

'That PROVES his guilt,' said the 👑.

'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know
what they're about!'

'Read them,' said the 👑.

The White 🐇 put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?' he 🙏.

'Begin at the beginning,' the 👑 said gravely, 'and go on till you
come to the 🔚: then ⏹.'

These were the verses the White 🐇 read:--

   'They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could 🚯 🏊.

   He 📤 them word I had 🚯 gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave her 1️⃣, they gave him 2️⃣,
    You gave us 🔊 or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to 📐 them 🆓,
    Exactly as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

   Don't let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A ㊙, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.'

'That's the most important piece of evidence we've 🇭🇲 yet,' said the
👑, rubbing his 👐; 'so now let the jury--'

'If any 1️⃣ of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting
him,) 'I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an ⚛ of
meaning in it.'

The jury all wrote 📩 on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an
⚛ of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the 🗞.

'If there's 🙊 meaning in it,' said the 👑, 'that saves a 🌏 of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know,'
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with 1️⃣ 👁; 'I seem to 🙈 some meaning in them, after all. "--SAID
I COULD 🚯 🏊--" you can't 🏊, can you?' he added, turning to the
Knave.

The Knave shook his 🗣 sadly. 'Do I look like it?' he said. (Which he
certainly did 🚯, being made entirely of cardboard.)

'All ⏯, so far,' said the 👑, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's the jury, of
course--"I GAVE HER 1️⃣, THEY GAVE HIM 2️⃣--" why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know--'

'But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said Alice.

'Why, there they are!' said the 👑 triumphantly, 👉 to the tarts
on the table. 'Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--"BEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my dear, I think?' he said to the
👑.

'Never!' said the 👑 furiously, throwing an inkstand at the 🦎
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little 💶 had ◀ 📴 ✍ on his
slate with 1️⃣ 🤘, as he found it made 🙊 ❗; but he now hastily
began again, 🇻🇮 the 🔏, that was trickling 📩 his 😡, as long as
it lasted.)

'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the 👑, looking round the court
with a 😆. There was a dead silence.

'It's a pun!' the 👑 added in an offended 🏽, and everybody 😂,
'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the 👑 said, for about the
twentieth time that day.

'🙊, 🙊!' said the 👑. 'Sentence 🥇--verdict afterwards.'

'Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. 'The 💡 of having the
sentence 🥇!'

'👬 your 👅!' said the 👑, turning purple.

'I 😤't!' said Alice.

'📴 with her 🗣!' the 👑 shouted at the 🔝 of her voice. Nobody
moved.

'Who 💅 for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her 🌝 size by this
time.) 'You're nothing but a pack of 📇!'

At this the whole pack 🌹 🆙 into the air, and came 🕊 📩 upon
her: she gave a little 😱, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them 📴, and found herself lying on the 🏦, with her
🗣 in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had 🍃 📩 from the 🎋 upon her 😡.

'Wake 🆙, Alice dear!' said her sister; 'Why, what a long 😴 you've
had!'

'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister 😽 her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your 🍵; it's getting late.' So
Alice got 🆙 and ran 📴, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she ◀ her, leaning her 🗣 on her
✌, ⌚ the 📐 🌇, and thinking of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:--

🥇, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
👋 were clasped upon her knee, and the 🌞 eager 👀 were looking
🆙 into hers--she could 🙉 the very 🏾 of her voice, and 🙈 that
queer little toss of her 🗣 to keep 🔙 the wandering hair that
WOULD always get into her 👀--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister's dream.

The long grass rustled at her 🐾 as the White 🐇 hurried by--the
frightened 🐁 splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could 🙉 the rattle of the 🍵 as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-🔚 meal, and the shrill voice of the 👑
ordering 📴 her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the 🐖-👶
was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while 🍽 and 📡 crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
🦎's slate-✏, and the choking of the suppressed 🇵🇬-🐷,
filled the air, mixed 🆙 with the distant 😭 of the miserable Mock
🐢.

So she sat on, with 📕 👀, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to 📬 them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
🎐, and the pool rippling to the 🏴 of the reeds--the rattling
🍵 would change to tinkling 🐑-🛎, and the 👑's shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd 👦--and the sneeze of the 👶, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the 🔅
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock 🐢's
heavy 😭.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown 👩; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and 🏩 💔 of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make THEIR 👀 🌞 and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own 🚸-life, and the happy summer days.
